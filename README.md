# Hello World! :computer:


ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chinchay, interested in data science and machine learning applied to Physics. Iâ€™m currently
learning how to handle databases and artificial intelligence algorithms to accelerate materials discovery and how
they can be used to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where my C++, Python, or data analysis skills
can be useful.
